::page{title="Complete the EDA with SQL lab"}

You will need to import and complete the following Jupyter notebook in IBM Watson Studio:

**Right-click the following link, and copy its URL then import it to Watson Studio:**

[EDA with SQL](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module_2/jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera.ipynb)

If you need help with importing notebook to Watson Studio, refer to this lab:

[Import a Notebook into Watson Studio](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/AddingNotebook_toWatson.md.html)

If you see `Failed to Load Notebook` error message, you may go back and check your Notebook list to see if it is a
false alarm that your notebook could be imported already.
